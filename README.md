Excel Sales Performance Dashboard using Pivot Tables and Slicers
## Project Summary

This project presents an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel using the Superstore dataset (10,195 records).

The goal of this project was to transform raw transactional sales data into meaningful business insights using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, and calculated metrics.

The dashboard provides a high-level overview of revenue, profitability, customer performance, and regional trends in a clean and interactive format.
## Business Problem

Management needs a clear and interactive way to:

- Monitor total revenue and profit performance
- Identify the most profitable regions
- Analyze category-level sales contribution
- Understand customer concentration and top contributors
- Track overall profit margins

Raw data alone does not provide actionable insight, so a dynamic dashboard was developed.
